## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- JavaScript
- SCSS (Sass)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

- **Responsive Design**: I learned how to create a responsive layout using Flexbox and media queries to ensure that the game looks good on both mobile and desktop devices. This involved adjusting styles and elements based on screen size.

- **State Management**: I implemented state management to keep track of the score and game status, which taught me how to handle dynamic data in a JavaScript application.

- **Game Logic**: I gained a deeper understanding of how to implement game logic, including the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors, and the additional Lizard and Spock rules. This helped me practice conditional statements and event handling in JavaScript.

- **SCSS (Sass) Features**: I utilized SCSS to manage my styles more efficiently, taking advantage of features like variables, nesting, and mixins, which made my stylesheets cleaner and easier to maintain.

- **User Experience**: I focused on creating an engaging user experience by providing visual feedback (such as winning/losing animations) and ensuring that the game was easy to understand and play.

- **Debugging and Problem-Solving**: Throughout the development process, I encountered and resolved various challenges, which improved my debugging skills and problem-solving abilities in web development.
